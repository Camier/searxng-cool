- name: genius lyrics
  engine: genius_lyrics
  shortcut: gen
  categories: [music, lyrics]
  api_key: YOUR_ACTUAL_GENIUS_API_KEY

## Usage Examples

### Basic Search:
```
!disc pink floyd        # Search Discogs for Pink Floyd
!jam jazz              # Search Jamendo for jazz music  
!sc electronic         # Search SoundCloud for electronic music

!ytm rock music time:week    # YouTube Music from last week
!sce dubstep time:month      # SoundCloud from last month
```

## Troubleshooting

### Archive.org Audio Not Working:
The engine is implemented but not returning results. Possible issues:
1. API endpoint may have changed
2. Query formatting might need adjustment
3. The engine may need to be reloaded in SearXNG

### To Debug:
```bash
# Check if engine is loaded
curl -s "http://localhost:8888/preferences" | grep -i "archive"

# Test API directly
curl -s "https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php?q=mediatype:audio+AND+music&output=json&rows=5"
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Deezer Engine**: Implement if API access is available
2. **Spotify Metadata**: Add Spotify search (metadata only due to API restrictions)
3. **Last.fm Integration**: Add scrobbling data and recommendations
4. **Apple Music**: Investigate API possibilities
5. **Fix Archive.org**: Debug and fix the audio search
6. **Unified Music Search**: Create a meta-engine that searches multiple sources

## Conclusion

The SearXNG music search implementation now provides comprehensive coverage across:
- Commercial platforms (YouTube, SoundCloud)
- Independent platforms (Bandcamp, Jamendo)  
- DJ/Mix platforms (MixCloud)
- Metadata services (Discogs, Genius)
- Curated radio (Radio Paradise)

With 11 working engines, users can discover, stream, and purchase music from a wide variety of sources, all while maintaining their privacy through SearXNG's proxy.

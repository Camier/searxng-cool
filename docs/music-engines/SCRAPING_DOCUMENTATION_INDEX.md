## üß™ Test Scripts

### Engine Testing
- `/tests/music-engines/test_all_music_engines.py` - Test all active engines
- `/tests/music-engines/test_new_engines.py` - Test newly implemented engines
- `/tests/music-engines/test_phase3_engines.py` - Test Phase 3 web engines
- `/tests/music-engines/test_phase4_engines.py` - Test Phase 4 enhanced engines

### Analysis Scripts
- `/scripts/analyze_music_sources.js` - Playwright script to analyze music scraping sources

## üéµ Engine Source Code

### Base Infrastructure
- `/searx/engines/base_music.py` - Base class for all music engines

### Implemented Engines
- `/searx/engines/lastfm.py` - Last.fm API integration
- `/searx/engines/free_music_archive.py` - FMA web scraping
- `/searx/engines/beatport.py` - Electronic music scraping
- `/searx/engines/musicbrainz.py` - Music metadata API

### Attempted Engines (Phase 3)
- `/searx/engines/spotify_web.py` - Spotify web scraping (blocked)
- `/searx/engines/apple_music_web.py` - Apple Music scraping (blocked)
- `/searx/engines/tidal_web.py` - Tidal web scraping (blocked)
- `/searx/engines/musixmatch.py` - Lyrics scraping (403 errors)

### Attempted Engines (Phase 4)
- `/searx/engines/musictoscrape.py` - Practice site (no results)
- `/searx/engines/allmusic.py` - Music database (no results)
- `/searx/engines/pitchfork.py` - Music reviews (timeouts)

## üìä Test Results & Data

### Engine Test Results
- `/music_engine_results/` - Directory with JSON test results for all engines
- `/music_engine_test_report.md` - Consolidated test report
- `/music_engine_analysis_summary.md` - Analysis of engine performance

## üîç Key Insights

### Working Engines (5)
1. Last.fm - API-based
2. Deezer - Existing engine
3. Free Music Archive - Web scraping
4. Beatport - Web scraping
5. MusicBrainz - API-based

### Failed Due to Anti-Bot (20+)
- Commercial platforms (Spotify, Apple, Tidal)
- Even "open" sites (AllMusic, Pitchfork)
- Practice sites (MusicToScrape)

### Main Challenges
1. Dynamic JavaScript content
2. CloudFlare protection
3. Rate limiting
4. CAPTCHA challenges
5. User-agent detection
6. Redirect handling

### Recommendations
1. Focus on API-based solutions
2. Use playlist/chart scraping instead of search
3. Implement browser automation for critical sites
4. Add caching layer
5. Aggregate existing engines better

## üìù Usage

To implement a new music engine:
1. Read the implementation plan
2. Study the research documentation
3. Use base_music.py as foundation
4. Follow patterns from working engines
5. Test thoroughly with provided scripts

For debugging failed engines:
1. Check logs in `/logs/searxng.log`
2. Review anti-bot mitigation strategies
3. Consider alternative data sources
4. Test with simpler queries first
